/**
 * Ticket 008 — STUB. One Replay run: Recording -> pacer -> transport -> Run.
 *
 * Written test-first: `runOnce` throws. The behaviour is pinned by
 * runner.test.ts.
 *
 * ============================ API DESIGN (normative) =======================
 * runOnce({ recordingId, config, deps, signal? }) -> RunOnceResult
 *
 * - The recording's audio is fetched ONCE and paced through the ticket-007
 *   pacer: the transport receives 480-sample frames on a 20 ms schedule.
 * - `armTag` is DERIVED via deriveArmTag(config); a caller-supplied tag on
 *   the config is ignored (PRD §6).
 * - `origin` is always 'manual' — only the batch runner (ticket 009) produces
 *   'sweep'.
 * - Replay context is pinned to zero, both architectures. There is
 *   deliberately no context-policy argument.
 * - `speechEndMs` comes from the RECORDING, never re-derived from the
 *   waveform, so every Run of a Recording shares one t0.
 * - NOTHING AUTOPLAYS (PRD §7): the run buffers its output audio and reports
 *   it ready. `timings.audio_queued` is stamped when the first sample is
 *   decoded and queued — playback is the caller's business and never moves it.
 * - A run that loses a stage is saved with status 'failed' plus the failing
 *   stage, is still POSTed, and runOnce RESOLVES rather than throwing.
 * ==========================================================================
